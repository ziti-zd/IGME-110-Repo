## One-offs
These countries are ethnically and linguistically isolated from their neighbors.
- [Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary). Hungarian is an **Uralic** language, closer to Finnish than any of its neighbors.
- [Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania). Romanian is- against all odds- a **Romance** language!
- [Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania). Albanian is the modern descendent of an ancient **Indo-European** language, which is the overarching language family most languages in the world belong to.
- [Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece). I don't think it needs to be said what language Greece speaks.
- [Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey). Somewhat unsurprisingly, Turkey speaks a **Turkic** language.
